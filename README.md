- I learned how to use DOM manipulation, keeping task datas using local storage in this project.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

Some JS code I'm proud of
```javascript 
   function removeTask(index) {
    tasks.splice(index, 1)
    localStorage.setItem('tasks', JSON.stringify(tasks));
}
```
